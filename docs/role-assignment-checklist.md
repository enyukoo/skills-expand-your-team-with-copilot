## Tips for Success

### For Small Teams

- **Combine Roles:** One person can fill multiple roles. For example:
  - Process Owner + Quality Reviewer
  - Project Facilitator + Onboarding Lead
  - Documentation Specialist + Process Owner

- **Rotate Roles:** Consider rotating roles every few months so everyone learns different skills

- **Be Flexible:** Don't force roles if your team is very small. Start with the most critical ones

### For Larger Teams

- **Consider Co-leads:** For larger projects, have two people share certain roles
- **Add Specialized Roles:** You might need additional specialized roles for complex projects
- **Create Role Teams:** Multiple people can support a single role (e.g., multiple Quality Reviewers)

### General Advice

1. **Match Skills to Roles:** Put people in roles that use their strengths
2. **Consider Development:** Use roles to help people develop new skills
3. **Get Input:** Ask team members which roles interest them
4. **Document Everything:** Keep records of assignments and changes
5. **Review Regularly:** Roles should evolve as the project and team grow
